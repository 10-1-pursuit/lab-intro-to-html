        <br>
        <b>GELATO ALLA NOCCIOLA ~Hazelnut Icecream~ </b></h2>
        The most commonly seen designs, such as the 'ordinary' or standard garden sundial, cast a shadow on a flat
        surface marked with the hours of the day. As the position of the sun changes, the time indicated by the
        shadow changes. However, sundials can be designed for any surface where a fixed object
        casts a predictable shadow. Most sundial designs indicate apparent solar time.
        Minor design variations can measure standard and daylight saving time, as well.

            <li> 1/2 teaspoon salt</li>

        <h3> Instructions </h3>
        <ol>
            <p align="left">
                <li> Place the hazelnuts in the work bowl of a food processor fitted with the metal blade. Pulse
                    until coarsely chopped. With the motor running, drizzle in 6 to 8 tablespoons of milk, enough to
                    form a
                    creamy paste, about 1 minute. Scrape the nut paste into a bowl.</li>
                <br>
                <li> Heat the 3 cups milk and 1 cup cream in a saucepan over medium heat. When the mixture is hot
                    (but not boiling) whisk in the nutella until completely melted. Remove from the heat.</li>
                <br>
                <li> Combine the egg yolks, sugar and salt in a bowl and whisk until thick and pale yellow. Whisk in
                    the hazelnut oil 1 tablespoon at a time, if using. Slowly dribble in a ladleful of the hot milk
                    mixture,
                    whisking constantly to prevent the eggs from curdling. Whisk in another ladleful of the hot milk
                    mixture, then slowly whisk the egg mixture back into the hot milk. Stir in the hazelnut paste and
                    set over medium-low heat. Cook, stirring constantly, for 15 to 20 minutes or until a custard forms
                    that
                    lightly coats the back of a wooden spoon or spatula. </li>
                <br>
                <li> Strain the hot custard through a fine-mesh sieve into a heatproof bowl. Place a sheet of plastic
                    wrap directly on the surface of the custard to prevent a skin from forming. </li>
                <br>
                <li>Refrigerate for at least 4 hours and up to overnight. Freeze the custard in an ice cream machine
                    according to the
                    manufacturer's instructions. When thickened, spoon the gelato into a container with a tight-fitting
                    lid, cover, and
                    freeze until firm, about 4 hours. To serve, remove the gelato from the freezer and let sit for about
                    5 minutes before scooping into bowls.</li>
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>

                NOTE: Many supermarkets carry packages of hazelnuts that have already been toasted and skinned. But it's
                not hard to do it yourself, and it's usually less expensive to buy them raw (and even less expensive if
                you buy them in the shell and shell them yourself). Heat the oven to 350Â° F. Spread the shelled
                hazelnuts out on a rimmed baking sheet. Toast for 10 to 15 minutes, until the skins have started to
                crack and the nuts are fragrant. Wrap the nuts in a clean kitchen towel and let them sit for 1 minute.
                Then rub the nuts in the towel to loosen and remove the skins. Let cool completely before using.
