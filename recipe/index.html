		<h2>Description:</h2>

		<p>
			<em>
				<strong>Brioche</strong> and <strong>challah</strong> bread make the
				best French toast. Both are already so eggy that once dipped in the
				batter and griddled in butter they become custard-like on the inside.
				The nicely browned and caramelized outside is thanks in part to the
				added sugar in the egg mixture. And playing with the flavor is easy:
				This recipe has a touch of warmth from cinnamon, nutmeg and vanilla.

				<aside>
					Here&#39;s a <strong>pro tip</strong>: Make sure you don&#39;t
					over-soak the bread. Fully submerge it in the batter for only a few
					seconds and let any excess drip off before cooking. And wait for the
					bubbles from the melted butter to subside â€” that&#39;s when you know
					your pan is hot enough.
