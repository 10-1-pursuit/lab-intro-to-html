    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>This is such a good dish that I modified to be plant based. I have experimented with different ingredients and I
        Have found the right things that makes it tastes the best.</p>

    <hr />

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>Kale</li>
        <li>Sweet Potato</li>
        <li>1 Red Onion</li>
        <li>1 Green Pepper</li>
        <li>2 Vegetable Stock</li>
        <li>Salt, Ground Pepper, Basil, Italian Seasoning</li>
        <li>Avacado Oil</li>
        <li></li>


    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Because the sweet potatos takes the longest to cook, we're going to prepare it first by cleaning and
            chopping it up. Once that is done put it in a pot or something to hold it.</li>
        <li>Next on to the green pepper and onions. Chop them up and put them into a large pot. Drizzle in some avacado
            oil, season it(with the salt, ground pepper, basil, and italian seasoning) and turn on the stove to medium
            heat</li>
        <li>While that's cooking wash the kale and break it apart either with your hand or a knife</li>
        <li>Then once the red onions get translucent and maybe a little brown put in the vegetable stock. You want it to
            almost fill the pot. Don't over fill it though because you still need to add the sweet potatos and kale.
        </li>
        <li></li>
        <li></li>

    </ol>
