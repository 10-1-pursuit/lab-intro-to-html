		<h2>Description</h2>

		<p>
			<em>
				<strong>Brioche</strong> and <strong>challah</strong> bread make the
				best French toast. Both are already so eggy that once dipped in the
				batter and griddled in butter they become custard-like on the inside.
				The nicely browned and caramelized outside is thanks in part to the
				added sugar in the egg mixture. And playing with the flavor is easy:
				This recipe has a touch of warmth from cinnamon, nutmeg and vanilla.

				<aside>
					Here’s a <strong>pro tip</strong>: Make sure you don’t over-soak the
					bread. Fully submerge it in the batter for only a few seconds and let
					any excess drip off before cooking. And wait for the bubbles from the
					melted butter to subside — that’s when you know your pan is hot
					enough.
