    <h2>Fried Egg Sandwhich</h2>
    <p>This is what I made for breakfast this morning. Personally, I hate the taste of Avocado but I will admit that this would probably make a great addition to avocado toast.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>

        <li>Cheese - I prefer Havarti or Swiss</li>
        <li>1 Egg</li>
        <li>2 slices of tomato OR pico de gallo</li>
        <li>Chilli oil</li>
        <li>Salt n Peppa</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Directions:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Toast your bread.</li>
        <li>Heat up a pan on the stove on medium-low heat.</li>
        <li>Place a healthy spoonful of chilli oil in the pan and give it a minute to warm up.</li>
        <li>Crack your egg into the pan. Add salt and pepper to taste and place a lid over it to make it cook faster.</li>
        <li>Add your favorite cheese to one of the toasted slices. You can melt the cheese onto the bread in the microwave or by broiling in the oven.</li>
        <li>Add your tomato slices or pico ontop of the cheese.</li>
        <li>When the egg whites are fully cooked, but the yolk is not, transfer the egg onto the slice of bread. Place the other slice on top, and dig in!</li>
