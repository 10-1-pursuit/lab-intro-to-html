  <h2>French Toast Ingredients and Substitutes</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Bread</strong> – I love French toast made with challah bread, brioche, or thick slices of Sally Lunn
      bread. But
      I have a little secret. If you don’t have those on hand, it is absolutely delicious and easy with slices of our
      favorite sandwich bread. Use whatever you have on hand!
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Eggs</strong> – you will need large eggs for this recipe.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Milk</strong> – you can use your favorite milk or dairy-free milk alternative.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Salt</strong> – add a pinch of salt to balance the flavors and sweetness
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Sweetener</strong> – you definitely have options for the sweetener to use based on your personal
      preferences.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Flavorings</strong> – I love to include vanilla extract and ground cinnamon for a classic French toast
      flavor.
      You can
      omit
      the cinnamon, if you prefer, or add more for a more pronounced cinnamon French Toast. You can also add nutmeg if
      you
      like.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Butter</strong> – melted on the griddle for cooking and then add a tablespoon butter for serving, if
      desired.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Maple syrup</strong> – real maple syrup is required in our family for the perfect French toast! You can
      also use
      a fruit
      syrup like my blackberry syrup if you prefer.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>How to Make Easy French Toast Recipe</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <strong>Whisk</strong> To save on dishes and cleanup, I whisk together the eggs, milk, sweetener, vanilla extract,
      and
      ground cinnamon right into a shallow dish I’ll use to dip my bread in.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>
      <strong>Dip</strong> Once I have whisked the egg mixture together well, I place my bread slice in on one side and
      then
      quickly flip it over to the other side since some sandwich bread will absorb the liquid super quickly. You’ll want
      to be sure that you are dipping your bread and not leaving it for any time to soak so that the bread does not
      absorb too much liquid. Make sure to follow this so your bread does not get too wet. This will prevent your French
      toast from becoming soggy.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>
      <strong>Cook</strong>Once both sides of the bread are coated with the liquid, I place them into the skillet with
      melted
      butter set over medium heat. They only take a few minutes to cook, about 2 to 3 minutes on each side.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>
      <strong>Serve</strong> Serve immediately with your syrup of choice. I also love to serve with fruit like fresh
      berries (I
      love blackberries, blueberries, strawberries, and raspberries). A dollop of homemade whipped cream is always a
      good idea!
    </li>
  </ol>
