    Crispy, gooey, melty, ultra-cheesy—the best mozzarella sticks are the ones you make at home! No special equipment or ingredients needed!
</p>
<hr />
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>Flour 
    Sea Salt
    Pepper
    Garlic powder
    Eggs
    Panko
    Italian seasoning
    Low-moisture mozzarella cheese or string cheese (yep, you can make mozzarella sticks with string cheese—truly the easiest trick ever!)
    mozarella cheese sticks beside bowls of flour, panko and eggs for homemade mozzarella sticks
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        Grab three bowls and line them up. 
        One bowl is for flour, salt, pepper and garlic powder. The second bowl is for the whisked egg thinned with a bit of water. The third bowl is for the panko and Italian seasoning.
        Time to coat your mozzarella sticks! Take one string cheese piece or mozzarella cheese piece and dip it in each bowl. Start with a dip in the egg, then the flour, then the egg, and lastly in the panko mixture. So that’s three bowls, four dippings total! Yes, your fingers will get a little messy! Yes, this is a great job for the kids to help out with! Once again, the best mozzarella stick dipping order is egg -->flour-->egg-->panko.
        Freeze! Yep, you’ve got to freeze those sticks before you drop them in the oil. Lay them on a baking sheet and freeze them for at least 45 minutes.
        Fry! Once your oil reaches 350°F, fry the mozzarella sticks. Only fry a few mozzarella sticks at a time and keep an eye on the oil temperature. If you see the number dropping, stop adding mozzarella sticks and give the oil a chance to heat back up—you don’t want to drop the oil temperature too much, or the sticks will turn out soggy instead of crispy.
        Cool! This is essential. Let those crispy, golden, perfect mozzarella sticks cool a bit before eating. Trust us on this one.
        Eat! Serve them with some marinara sauce for dipping, if you really want to have the best mozzarella stick experience ever!
